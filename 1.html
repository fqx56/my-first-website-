    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/" target="_blank" title="html5-specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) </a> is the standard markup language for documents designed
    to be <strong>displayed in a <u>web</u> browser.<br></strong>It defines the content and structure of web content.
    It is often assisted by technologies such as CascadingStyle Sheets (CSS) and scripting
    languages such as JavaScript.</p> <img src="coding.jpg" width="500">
    <p style="margin-top: 40px;">Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
    <br>HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 40px;">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may
    be embedded into the rendered page.<br> HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text 
    such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.</p>
